###### Cyber security careers are becoming more in demand and offer high salaries. There are many different jobs within the security industry, from offensive pentesting (hacking machines and reporting on vulnerabilities) to defensive security (defending against and investigating cyberattacks).

##### Why get a career in cyber:

###### High Pay - jobs in security have high starting salaries
###### Exciting - work can include legally hacking systems or defending against cyber attacks
###### Be in demand - there are over 3.5 million unfilled cyber positions
