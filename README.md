## Extra Notes

### My Security Cheat Sheet Wikeypaydia 

I have a few notes, not yet very well organised, but you can take a look at it if you want. Could be helpful.

- <https://github.com/dvanmosselbeen/security-cheat-sheet/wiki>

### Internet access not working with the TryHackMe VPN?

Information difficult to find without a link on the website :-P

Source: <https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/openvpn/troubleshooting/openvpn-troubleshooting/#external-access-not-working>

```commandline                             
$ nmcli connection   # Note the name of the VPN connection here
$ nmcli connection edit <CONNECTION_NNAME>
> set ipv4.never-default true
> set ipv6.never-default true
> save
> quit
```

These changes are persistent.

### Make gobuster go even slower

By merging the 2 most common and most used `wordlists`. You have better enumeration results. However, by merging these wordlist as show here, we create duplicated entries. and thus we need to make use of the uniq command. But to make use of the uniq command we need to sort the final output file. These wordlist are made so that the most common used words come on top

Found this very interesting to do, for room https://tryhackme.com/room/wgelctf for example. As i mainly use the `dirbuster` wordlist, did not find the required files in first instance.

- `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`
- `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`

As for example the `common.txt` would find out a folder `.ssh` which is extreme important. However, common.txt is also too common and does not find a lot of things.

Quick and dirty fix for this:

````commandline
$ mkdir -p ~/tools
$ cat /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt >> /tmp/gobusted_tmp.txt
$ cat  /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt >> /tmp/gobusted_tmp.txt
$ sort /tmp/gobusted_tmp.txt -o /tmp/gobusted_sorted.txt && uniq /tmp/gobusted_sorted.txt > ~/tools/gobusted.txt
````

You can make the scan fast by specifying the numbers of threats you want to use. By default, it is 10 threats and safe. But note that some servers / services (depending on their config) does not like at all many threats. And thus you could get timeouts. But it is always worth trying. 

````commandline
$ gobuster help dir | grep -e "-t"
...
