## Task 1. Info Introduction
Password cracking is part of the penetration tester job but is rarely taught on challenges platforms. In this room you will learn to how to crack hashes, identify hash types, create custom wordlists, find specific wordlists, create mutations rules, etc.

This room is a spiritual successor to Crack the Hash.

I recommend you to have done the room Crack the hash before attempting this one, which is harder and will use more advanced techniques.

However this room include a course about hash cracking before you have to face the cracking challenges, it may be a good idea to read the course part before doing Crack the hash if you are a new comer.
