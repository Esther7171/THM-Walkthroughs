## Task 1. Introduction
Cybersecurity is big business in the modern-day world. The hacks that we hear about in newspapers are from exploiting vulnerabilities. In this room, we're going to explain exactly what a vulnerability is, the types of vulnerabilities and how we can exploit these for success in our penetration testing endeavours.

An enormous part of penetration testing is knowing the skills and resources for whatever situation you face. This room is going to introduce you to some resources that are essential when researching vulnerabilities, specifically, you are going to be introduced to:

* What vulnerabilities are
* Why they're worthy of learning about
* How are vulnerabilities rated
* Databases for vulnerability research
* A showcase of how vulnerability research is used on ACKme's engagement
