### Task 1. Introduction

Erlang is a programming language made for building reliable, real-time systems that can handle many users at once. It was originally created by Ericsson for telecom use but is now used in many industries to build distributed systems.

OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of tools and libraries that work with Erlang to help build these systems. Even though it started in telecom, OTP is now used more broadly for any kind of distributed application. Together, they're often called Erlang/OTP.

Erlang is used by many companies for product development and by universities for teaching and research.

One part of OTP is the SSH module, which lets Erlang systems use secure shell access and transfer files safely.

Recently, a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-32433) was found in the Erlang/OTP SSH. It allows attackers to run code on the system without logging in. This issue was discovered by researchers at Ruhr University Bochum and has a CVSS score of 10.0, which means itâ€™s extremely serious.S
